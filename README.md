# Chess
Chess game I develop as a challenge for myself (& Mikkel) with Java and JavaFX.

Current known bugs and missing implementation:
- AI needs to get a copy of board
- If AI is white, nothing happens
- Controls for starting new game and choosing players
- Test pawn and king
- Selection of promotion type
- Improve all tests
- 50 moves without moving any pawn
- 3 way stalemate
