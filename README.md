# Chess
Chess game I develop as a challenge for myself (& Mikkel) with Java and JavaFX.

Current known bugs and missing implementation:
- Promotion of pawn always ends in queen
- Some other bugs with promotion of pawn
- Missing checkmate rules
- Mising stalemate rules
- AI needs to get a copy of board
- If AI is white, nothing happens
- Controls for starting new game and choosing players
