# Chess
Chess game I develop as a challenge for myself (& Mikkel) with Java and JavaFX.

Current known bugs and missing implementation:
- Fix pawn attacks...
- Test pawn and king
- When AI vs. AI no board animation
- Move backwards in history
- Improve all tests
- Selection of promotion type
- AI needs to get a copy of board
